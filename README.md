# Concrete Slab Weight Calculator using Solara ☀️

A simple, illustrative Python application showcasing [Solara's](https://solara.dev) dashboard capabilities. This project, while functional, serves primarily as a learning tool to create and format a UI and is not intended for serious engineering use. 🚀

## Features
- Interactive UI for slab measurements. 📐
- Dynamic updates with Solara's reactive state management. 🌐
